## üöÄ About the Project

**Rust Learning Project** is a basic example program written in Rust. The project includes some functions that show the use of variables, conditions, loops, structures and other things of Rust.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn the basics of Rust through examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

The project contains the following examples:

1. **Basic Output (`hello`)**  
   Simple text output using `println!`.

2. **Arithmetic (`math`)**  
   Example of basic operations with functions.

3. **Conditions (`condition`)**  
   Use of `if-else` to check variable values.

4. **Loops (`counter`, `whileloop`, `forloop`)**  
   - Infinite loop with `break`.
   - `while` loop for conditional repeating.
   - `for` loop for repeaing over a range.

5. **Structures (`structure`, `rectanglee`)**  
   - Definition and usage of custom data structures (`struct`).
   - Implementation of methods for structs.

6. **Ownership (`ownership`)**  
   Rust's ownership model with strings.

7. **Error Handling (`error`)**  
   Example of handling file operations with `match` and error handling.

8. **Vectors (`vector`)**  
   Introduction to dynamic arrays in Rust (`Vec<T>`).

9. **Hash Maps (`hashmap`)**  
   Demonstration of key-value storage using `HashMap`.

10. **Modules (`modules`)**  
    Shows how to organize code into modules and use them in your program.
