## üöÄ About the Project

**Rust Learning Project** is a basic example program written in the Rust programming language that demonstrates key concepts of this language. The project includes several functions that illustrate the use of variables, conditions, loops, structures, traits, and other essential elements of Rust.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to learn the basics of Rust through practical examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

The project contains the following examples:

1. **Basic Output (`hello`)**  
   Demonstration of simple text output using `println!`.

2. **Arithmetic (`math`)**  
   Example of basic arithmetic operations with functions.

3. **Conditions (`condition`)**  
   Use of `if-else` to check variable values.

4. **Loops (`counter`, `whileloop`, `forloop`)**  
   - Infinite loop with `break`.
   - `while` loop for conditional iteration.
   - `for` loop for iterating over a range.

5. **Structures (`structure`, `rectanglee`)**  
   - Definition and usage of custom data structures (`struct`).
   - Implementation of methods for structs.

6. **Ownership (`ownership`)**  
   Demonstration of Rust's ownership model with strings.

7. **Error Handling (`error`)**  
   Example of handling file operations with `match` and error handling.

8. **Vectors (`vector`)**  
   Introduction to dynamic arrays in Rust (`Vec<T>`).

9. **Hash Maps (`hashmap`)**  
   Demonstration of key-value storage using `HashMap`.

10. **Modules (`modules`)**  
    Shows how to organize code into modules and use them in your program.
